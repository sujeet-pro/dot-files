# ~/.gitconfig-work - Work-specific Git config

# This is loaded automatically for any repo whose Git directory
# path starts with ~/work/ (as defined in ~/.gitconfig).

# Put:
#   - Work email
#   - Work-specific signing key (if any)
#   - Work-only settings

[user]
    # Name used in commits for WORK repositories.
    # This overrides the [user] section from ~/.gitconfig.
    name = Sujeet

    # Work email address (REPLACE with your actual work email).
    email = sujeet@company-name.com

    # If you use GPG/SSH signing for work commits, configure:
    # signingkey = <YOUR-WORK-GPG-OR-SSH-KEY-ID>

[commit]
    # If you want all work commits to be signed (GPG/SSH),
    # set this to true. Leave it false or comment out if your
    # company does not require signed commits.
    # gpgsign = true

[core]
    # If work uses a specific line ending policy, you can set:
    # autocrlf = input

    # Examples of work-specific behavior could go here.

    # Optional: SSH command override for work, if you use a dedicated
    # SSH key for work repos and want to ensure it is used.
    #
    # This is only needed if .ssh/config is not already handling it.
    # For any repo under ~/work, tell Git to use the "work" SSH key.
    #
    # -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work     -> identity file for work
    # -F ~/.ssh/config             -> still use your normal SSH config
    # sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work -F ~/.ssh/config
